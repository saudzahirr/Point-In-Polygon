Another approach to determine whether a point is inside a polygon is by calculating the area of the polygon
and then summing the areas of the triangles formed by each edge of the polygon with the point. If the sum of
these triangle areas equals the area of the polygon, the point lies inside the polygon; otherwise, it lies outside.

In 3D, a similar method applies to polyhedra. We calculate the volume of the polyhedron and
then sum the volumes of the pyramids formed by the point and each face of the polyhedron.
If the total volume of these pyramids equals the volume of the polyhedron, the point is inside
the polyhedron; otherwise, it is outside.
